Pederson spends her vacation seeing as much as possible of the world as quickly as possible. She is a partner in a large metal foundry in Rockford, Illinois and recently spent two days in Cape Town. At present Mrs. Pederson is on a vacation tour of two months which will take her through South Africa to the Victoria Falls, Tanganyika, Kenya, Egypt and Palestine and which will cost her $10,000. She travels only by air and by car. 'I am in too great a hurry and too restless to travel any other way - my vacation is too short, and there is yet so much more that I wish to see.' This is how she expressed herself last evening to the Burger, after having completed a whole day tour of Cape Town and the vicinity. She spends at the most a few days in a country, and the twenty days which she is spending in South Africa will be the longest that she has ever devoted to touring in one country. She has been travelling since 1925.\"--From included typescript, \"Her dress will reflect a typical African atmosphere\", translation of article in Afrikaans."]}},{"label":{"none":["Contributor"]},"value":{"none":["Pederson, Lydia Luhman, 1905-1993 (Compiler)","Pederson, Lydia Luhman, 1905-1993 (Photographer)","Pederson, Lydia Luhman, 1905-1993 (Filmmaker)"]}},{"label":{"none":["Date"]},"value":{"none":["1953"]}},{"label":{"none":["Department"]},"value":{"none":["Herskovits Library of African Studies"]}},{"label":{"none":["Dimensions"]},"value":{"none":["46-49 cm in diameter"]}},{"label":{"none":["Genre"]},"value":{"none":["16mm (photographic film size)","film reels"]}},{"label":{"none":["Last Modified"]},"value":{"none":["2022-09-30T20:32:12.359870Z"]}},{"label":{"none":["Language"]},"value":{"none":["English"]}},{"label":{"none":["Materials"]},"value":{"none":["4 film reels (sound, color or black-and-white)"]}},{"label":{"none":["Rights Statement"]},"value":{"none":["In Copyright"]}},{"label":{"none":["Subject"]},"value":{"none":["Pederson, Lydia Luhman, 1905-1993","Voyages and travels","Southern Africa","Eastern Africa"]}}],"summary":{"none":["Trip was made in January-March 1953.","Film reel containers are annotated: Native dancing & customs in South Africa (16 mm, Kodachrome, 1350 feet). -- Pretoria - Animals - Misc Zulus -- Misc dances - Pondos - misc. film with & without sound stripe -- Good Zulu dance -- Extra fire walking. -- Shembe, mass marriage. -- Black & white : Animals, various customs."]},"requiredStatement":{"label":{"none":["Attribution"]},"value":{"none":["Courtesy of Northwestern University Libraries","These recordings are from material in the collections of the Herskovits Library of African Studies of Northwestern University Libraries, are provided for use by its students, faculty and staff, and by other researchers visiting this site, for research consultation and scholarly purposes only.
