This path, known as the Cape-to-Cairo route, was a common trajectory for Western tourists like Lydia, who engaged numerous travel agencies to aid her voyage. Along the way she accrued objects and documented her thoughts on the peoples and cultures she encountered, reflecting the biases of a wealthy American woman. Many years later, the objects she gathered were donated to Northwestern libraries, where they form the Lydia Luhman Pederson collection at the Herskovits Library of African Studies. The collection consists of travel receipts, films, correspondence, documentary scripts, and the objects Lydia purchased. \", _jsx(\"br\", {}), _jsx(\"br\", {}), \"This digital exhibit explores this collection as a representation of what tourism reveals, and what it masks.
