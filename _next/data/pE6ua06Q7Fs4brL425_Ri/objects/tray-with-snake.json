A prominent one among them was Onírèsé, who was identified by an Ifa priest at birth as a great leader.

A classic example is the ‘Tray with the design of snake.’ Snakes are revered in many parts of Africa. For example, python depicts war god ‘Ogidia’ among the people of Benin and Brass of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Similarly, snakes are significant in Yoruba tradition, symbolizing rebirth and renewal. This symbolism is deeply rooted in Yoruba mythology, where the snake is associated with Osumare, a rainbow serpent god. The god is the son of the goddess Yemọja and the God Ọ̀rúnmìlà. Because snakes shade their skin, the god is associated with rebirth or renewal.
