Further pages revealed typical postcards of the period, scenic photographs and letters from her niece. What immediately stood out was the center of the scrapbook.

She was enamored by the idea of Africa’s mystery. She seemingly blinded herself willingly to what didn’t fit her vision, openly acknowledging that the Africa of cities and modernization is not the true Africa to her. She got tired as her long trip went on, her notes and purchases slowly petering off as she worked her way up to Egypt. She was independent, going on this trip alone without her husband in the 1950s. She was creative and generous, wanting to share her experiences with the people back home who would never have the same opportunity. Lydia left us her Africa in her letters, notes, works of art, and receipts that she collected along the way.

I combed through thousands of pages of museum databases in search of comparatives that could give me a hint as to their origin. I looked in books and catalogues and online auction listings. I did my best to narrow it down, but often my identification must remain unproven. Tourist art of this ilk has not traditionally been valued by museums and, without going to Africa myself, I am left with the research I have been able to assemble, hopeful that it is helpful or interesting in some way to those who stumble upon this project.

And so I asked myself, how do I value African makers without only seeing them through Lydia’s eyes?

Discussions with Basia Kapolka, and Yian Wang were edifying, productive, and stimulating. As we worked through the thorny conceptualization of the project, the practicalities of executing our ideas, and the bumps that cropped up along the way, I was reminded of the importance of community to creation.
