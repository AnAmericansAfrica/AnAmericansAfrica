It was a prosperous region owing to its extensive deposits of natural minerals like copper. By the 1950s, revolutionary sentiment had begun stirring among Africans who spoke out against the subjugation of the colonial regime.

By 1953, the government had already banned marriage between White and Black populations, instituted an official racial categorization system for all individuals, and separated the different groups into different areas of settlement, often displacing Indigenous groups.

In the early ‘50s, while Lydia was in Kenya, the Mau Mau Uprising took place, as native Africans took up arms against the colonial government. Many combatants and sympathizers were killed or tortured by the British in their attempt at suppression. Lydia briefly mentions seeing the bodies of nine dead Mau Maus but she says little else about her reaction to the evidence of violence. She stayed at the famed Treetops Hotel, where the year prior Elizabeth II had learned of her father’s passing and became queen.
