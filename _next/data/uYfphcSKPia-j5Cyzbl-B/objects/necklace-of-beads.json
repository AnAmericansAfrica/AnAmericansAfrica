Such objects do not carry the traces of their makers to Western eyes like my own. As a novice to twentieth-century African art, I first had to learn the language of beadwork styles that differentiated one cultural group from another in South Africa. The choices of colors, the motifs, the patterns - all signify the generic identity of its creator in subtle but important ways, alluding to regional and cultural traditions passed down through generations. I had assumed that it would be Zulu, given Lydia’s extensive references to them in the notes she made during her trip, but nothing fit. It did not share the classic seven-color palette of Msinga, the predominance of red/white/black/green of Nongoma, the stripes of Ndwedwe, or the ornate lacey techniques of Maphumulo. I was, it turned out, looking in all the wrong places based on my prior expectations.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"This necklace was instead made by a woman of the Ndebele tribe. In the nineteenth century, many Ndebele were forced to become indentured servants on the farms of white Afrikaners. The trauma of dislocation was perpetuated in the twentieth century with the institution of apartheid and subsequent establishment of KwaNdebele. In the 1950s, as Lydia traveled throughout South Africa, many Indigenous women, Ndebele and otherwise, sold their beaded wares on roadsides, while their objects also worked their way into the wares of curios shops in major centers like Durban. Though beads were only introduced to Africa by Europeans around the middle of the nineteenth century, they were quickly incorporated into preexisting Ndebele traditions. The codification of beaded adornment styles allowed them to mark periods of womanhood as they moved progressively from young girls to married mothers. They wore the beads themselves and gifted them to lovers; messages could be encoded to the man in the pattern and use of color, rebuking his behavior or professing her own devotion, though such hidden messages had already begun to fall out of traditional cultural knowledge by the ‘50s. Within their original contexts, such objects held powerful symbolic value.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"As an art historian driven to understand what secrets this object could possibly hold, I most wanted to untangle the meanings of the letters that adorn three of the four panels. One panel carries a symmetrical geometric motif in red, yellow, green, and blue against a white background, while the other three bear the letters TI, AS, and NA. I oriented the letters in every possible direction, looking futilely through writing samples and standard abbreviations of Indigenous sayings collected by researchers. Instead, I discovered that the Roman alphabet was often used as another decorative motif, the letters prized for their aesthetic forms rather than linguistic meaning.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"That the Ndebele transformed their art into commodities sold to tourists speaks to the fundamental ambivalence of this project - this necklace has been lifted from its indigenous milieu and meaning, divorced from the weight of Ndebele culture, its maker’s identity lost to history, yet this was all done voluntarily in service of the betterment of individual unknown lives. Women like Lydia contributed to their financial wellbeing yet also exploited and exoticized their difference from Western mores. Throughout my research for this essay, the necklace confounded my stereotypical expectations and, in a way, I am grateful for the obscurity of its meaning and the unanswered questions that remain; such cultural practices are not truly mine, or Lydia’s, to decode.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(\"strong\", {\n      children: \"By Arianna Ray \"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"Dimensions\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"95 cm (diameter)\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"IIIF Manifest\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [_jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/844a892d-a595-4727-a71d-41e69ad07f0f?as=iiif\",\n        children: \"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/844a892d-a595-4727-a71d-41e69ad07f0f?as=iiif\"\n      }), \"r reading\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"For further reading:\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Courtney-Clarke, Margaret.
