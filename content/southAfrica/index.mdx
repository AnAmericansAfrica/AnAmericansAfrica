# South Africa
  
## Introduction
 Lydia began her journey in January 1953 from South Africa, the southernmost country on the continent known for its diverse topography, natural beauty, and cultural richness. In this era, South Africa’s National Party had gained power on the basis of instituting apartheid, meaning “apartness” in Afrikaans. By 1953, the government had already banned marriage between White and Black populations, instituted an official racial categorization system for all individuals, and separated the different groups into different areas of settlement, often displacing Indigenous groups. Lydia traveled throughout South Africa for over three weeks, moving fluidly between these different spaces, both urban and rural, and particularly documenting her interactions with Indigenous Black communities.
