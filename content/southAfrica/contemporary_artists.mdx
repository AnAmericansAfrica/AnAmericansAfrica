# Comtemporary Artists
In this project, we incorporate the work of contemporary African artists as a response to the namelessness of the creators of the objects that Lydia collected. We center their perspectives to better understand the impact of White tourism on the historical record.

## William Kentridge

 Contemporary artist William Kentridge, raised as a white male in apartheid-era South Africa, has for decades experimented across diverse media to subtly explore the fraught history and heritage of his home country. His parents both worked as lawyers in the anti-apartheid movement, establishing the underlying socio-political basis that has permeated his career in drawing, painting, sculpture, opera, film, and more.

Of his early days as an artist, Kentridge states that, “[M]y initial career ambition was to sell some drawings and see how long I could survive before having to go back to the film industry. And I did sell enough drawings, but let it be said, for a white South African artist there were so many safety nets. My wife was a medical doctor so she had an income. There would have been family to catch me if they hadn’t sold. It is very different for black artists, who are usually much more out on a limb. And fundamentally that is still the case.”

Now, with decades of success under his belt, Kenteridge operates a large studio operation in Johannesburg, maintaining South Africa at the center of his work. Among his most famous works is the film Johannesburg - Second Greatest City after Paris, created by continuously modifying, erasing, and layering a series of charcoal drawings. This drawing from the film addresses the “procession of the dispossessed,” a theme that has recurred in Kentridge’s work for several decades.The film, made in 1989 while apartheid was still underway, follows two central characters named Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitelbaum, in the process exploring South African history. Viewers watch Soho amass wealth and power by exploiting Black workers; his counterpart, Felilx, is an artist, forming the alter ego to Soho with a greater emphasis on his anxiety and vulnerability. The two characters exist in symbiosis, revealing the guilt that all bear in the perpetuation of a racist society. The ghostly images of past drawings overlap past and present. 

The charcoal that opens Lydia’s scrapbook curiously echoes the material of Kentridge’s practice. Signed by Steve Mulimer, the drawing depicts a Black boy of 12 years with red eyes and red streaked on the side of his face and neck. The smudging of charcoal alternately highlights and shades the contours of the boy’s face. His flat expression and exaggerated features, however, reveal a vision of Africans that aligns more with Lydia’s characterization as primitive, dark, and foreign. That Lydia made this the first page of her scrapbook sets the tone for the remainder, in which Black Africans are largely treated as objects of ethnographic curiosity. Lydia repeatedly emphasizes the distance in culture between herself and the various groups she visits. In this, she exemplifies an attitude of the White gaze that Kentridge seeks to unveil and undermine.

## Mahlangu, Esther
Mahlangu’s trajectory to international acclaim is as intriguing as it is inspiring. Her first taste of widespread recognition came in 1989, at a European art exposition titled “Magiciens de la Terre” (Magicians of the World). The exposition, with its vision of showcasing art from across the world, was a revelation to the European audience, who found themselves entranced by Mahlangu’s unique style and expression.

In 1991, Mahlangu received an opportunity that further solidified her place in the global art scene. BMW, known for commissioning renowned artists to create unique “Art Cars,” extended an invitation to Mahlangu. Other artists who had graced this project included luminaries such as Andy Warhol, David Hockney, and Frank Stella. Esther, with her characteristic flair and exuberance, painted a BMW 525i, transforming it into the first “African Art Car.”

This wasn’t just any car, but a canvas that traversed roads and hearts alike, painted with motifs of the Ndebele tribe. With this, Esther Mahlangu not only broke the boundaries of the art world but also shattered the glass ceiling, being the first non-Western person and the first female to design a BMW Art Car. This vibrant automobile was later exhibited at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC, in 1994, and at the British Museum, London in 2017, further propelling Mahlangu’s name into the annals of art history.

One of her most notable exhibitions took place at the “South Africa: the art of a nation” at the British Museum in 2016-2017. This exhibition placed Mahlangu’s work amidst a vast collection of South African art spanning over 100,000 years. Her BMW Art Car was the highlight of this exhibition, earning her widespread acclaim.
