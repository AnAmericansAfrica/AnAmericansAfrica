## Essay
The ‘Tray with design of snake’ is a unique and intricately decorated calabash, crafted from a gourd. It holds a special place in Lydia Luhman Pederson's art collection, which her niece Sonjia Ulstad acquired during her 1967 voyage to Nigeria. The art of calabash carving and decoration is a prevalent form of expression in Nigeria. With their outer parts removed, gourds are skillfully carved to create designs from abstract patterns to animal shapes. These gourds are often dyed in vibrant red, black, and several other colors. 

Calabash in Nigeria serves various functions, including food storage, serving, and decoration. It can also be used as a musical instrument or a ritual object, reflecting its multifaceted role in Nigerian culture. In northern Nigeria, for instance, women selling sour milk often use beautifully designed gourd bowls, a testament to the aesthetic value placed on these objects. Calabash in Hausa language is called ‘kwarya’. Northern states such as Bauchi, Sokoto, Adamawa, Katsina, and Borno are known for producing burnt and engraved geometrical designs calabashes. However, they have no significant spiritual connotations, the decorations are primarily for aesthetic purposes. 

Calash decoration and usage is also common in Southwestern Nigeria. For example, it is prominent among the people of Oyo and other Yoruba speakers. Calabash is known in Yoruba as ‘igba’. Oyo is one of the most crafts-oriented towns in Yorubaland. In the ancient days of the O̩yo̩, at O̩yo̩-ilé, wood and calabash carvers were situated behind Aláàfin Oyo’s (supreme king of Oyo) Palace. A prominent one among them was Onírèsé, who was identified by an Ifa priest at birth as a great leader. At the commencement of the reign of a new Aláàfin, ‘Igba Iwà’ or calabashes of divination are brought from Ife to the new king to determine what his reign would be. 

Calabashes in Nigeria feature decorations of reptiles, birds, and other living things, each carrying its own symbolic meaning. A classic example is the ‘Tray with the design of snake.’ Snakes are revered in many parts of Africa. For example, python depicts war god ‘Ogidia’ among the people of Benin and Brass of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Similarly, snakes are significant in Yoruba tradition, symbolizing rebirth and renewal. This symbolism is deeply rooted in Yoruba mythology, where the snake is associated with Osumare, a rainbow serpent god. The god is the son of the goddess Yemọja and the God Ọ̀rúnmìlà. Because snakes shade their skin, the god is associated with rebirth or renewal. This belief is carried by practitioners of Yoruba religion in Nigeria, Benin, Brazil, and Cuba, making the 'Tray with the design of snake' a powerful cultural object.
