# Bows
## Abstract
Lydia purchased this bow/arrow while in the Belgian Congo; she recorded a receipt of the sale on a scrap of paper from Sabena Belgian Air Lines. She discusses learning how to use a bow and arrow while visiting a native group of hunter-gatherers, likely specifically the Mbuti, though she refers to them as “pygmies.” Her time with these Congolese people was marked by an ethnographic interest in their physical and cultural habits. Many Congolese indigenous tribes are reliant upon hunting rather than agriculture, making them proficient in using such weaponry. The small size of this bow would correlate with the traditionally short stature of such native Congolese ethnic groups, indicating that she perhaps purchased this set as a result of her visit, though the corresponding arrows are clearly decorative tourist items.
