# Doll
## Abstract
Though categorized as a doll, objects such as this one were no mere toys for the Ndebele girls who used them. They were made by young girls when they first reached puberty and used ritualistically in service of marriage, conception, and other rites of passage. Fertility dolls, as they are generally referred to, were handled by their bearers and carried great symbolic significance in the life of South African Ndebele, Zulu, and Xhosa girls. Stylistically, this doll evinces an Ndebele origin given its conical core and beaded cholwane hoops. In the 1950s and 1960s, such dolls were often sold on the roadside near Ndebele villages and it is likely that Lydia was not aware of its deeper purpose.
