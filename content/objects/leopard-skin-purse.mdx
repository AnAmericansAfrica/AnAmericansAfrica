## Essay
The leopard-skin purse in Lydia Pederson’s collection evokes the sensibilities of power, desire, travel, discovery, and femininity beyond 1953 when she traveled to Africa and collected the piece. Handbags have been the quintessential feminine accessory since the eighteenth century when they became popular in Europe. They were part of the material revolution of the century when the world was awash with new consumption habits and increased mobility. Handbags are a liberating appendage of women's attire for keeping personal belongings and the needs of those who usually depended on their care--children. They are a hallmark of concealment and a source of feminine independence and elegance. 

Lydia Pederson’s handbag is particularly compelling for its leopard pelt manufacture. Leopards evolved in Africa about 3 million years ago, at the beginning of the last Ice Age (Pleistocene). They are ecologically versatile animals and have been found in the wild in all vegetation zones of Africa, from the Mediterranean to the rainforest and beyond.   

Throughout African history, the leopard has been revered for its beauty, enigma, strength, swiftness, adaptability, and efficiency. As an apex predator, the leopard was associated with power and leadership. From Ancient Egypt to the Benin Kingdom, Kongo to Dahomey, kings, priests, warriors, and other high-ranking individuals donned leopard skin robes. They walked and sat on leopard skin carpets. Successful hunters exchanged leopard pelts for political favors and upward social mobility. A postcolonial African political leader and dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire), adopted the leopard print in his sartorial display.  With his leopard-skin hat and suit, Mobutu used the leopard imagery to project himself as a postcolonial reincarnation of Africa’s precolonial “warrior-ruler” tradition—a man to be feared and respected, generous and dangerous.

For most of African history, the leopard resided, sociologically, in the masculine domain because of its association with power and governance. Women of power also belonged to this masculine sphere. All of these changed in the early twentieth century as part of the disruptions caused by European colonialism in Africa. The European colonial settlers in East and Southern Africa targeted the big cats as among the enemies to be subdued. Many European and American sport hunters, seeking to realize their masculinity, traveled to Africa to hunt apex predators like lions, leopards, and cheetahs. This colonial masculinity fueled the desire for leopard pelts, which became synonymous with the modern white woman’s sensibility of luxury, femininity, and decadence. 

When Lydia Pederson traveled to Africa in the mid-century, the leopard print was the rage of high culture. It projected the independence, autonomy, defiance, and boldness of the upper- and middle-class new woman. Initially, this desire for femininity was fueled by the hunting of African leopards for their furs. Lydia Pederson’s travels in Africa embodied this independence of the new woman and the power of whiteness at the time. This leopard pelt purse and the accompanying documentation tell stories of curiosity, desire, power, and feminine elegance. It also reminds us of the colonial past and how Euro-American desire almost brought the leopard to extinction in Africa. The purse would have had an approving presence in the social scene, especially for its authenticity as a piece made from a leopard pelt, not a print. However, such authenticity is not without controversy today in conservation and animal rights circles. Pederson has carefully kept the documentation to maintain the integrity of this original piece, giving us a window to view the past and our role in its making and imagine how our present came to be.
