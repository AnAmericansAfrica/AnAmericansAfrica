<h4>Reflections on creating the digital exhibit</h4>

<h4>By Basia Kapolka </h4>

This digital exhibit began as a [Knight Lab Studio](https://studio.knightlab.com/) class project. Students were invited to view the Lydia Luhman Pederson collection and envision a website that would bring it to life in a digital form. The first cohort worked on the project in Fall of 2022, and a second cohort expanded on their work in Spring 2023. The imagination and skill these students brought to their creations was astounding, and their enthusiasm for the materials inspired me, as the new Digital Humanities Librarian, to try to complete a digital exhibit that could introduce a wider audience to Lydia’s travels.  I also wanted to give work experience in the digital humanities to Northwestern students, and to incorporate [Canopy](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/), an digital exhibit tool created by Northwestern Libraries developer, Mat Jordan.

Reflecting on the process, for me, quickly turns into a list of people to be grateful for. None of this would have been possible without the combined visions of Esmeralda Kale, Craig Stevens, the Knight Lab, and NUIT’s Media and Technology Innovation Services. 

I was incredibly fortunate to hire Arianna Ray and Yian Wang as my project team. They deserve all the credit for taking this project from an idea into an existing website. They both invested countless hours of research in unfamiliar areas, came up with creative solutions to explore Lydia’s collection, and learned new skills to contribute to the project. Arianna is responsible for most of the writing on the site–everything that is not credited to another author. Yian customized Canopy with her own vision to create the engaging site pages and the cartographical pamphlet that you see in the map section. I am deeply grateful to them for their willingness to engage with the collection and with me, and for their ability to improvise and experiment with the format of a digital exhibit. 

Craig Stevens photographed and created the 3D images of Lydia’s items, and it was his exhibit, [Augmented Curiosities](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/augmentedcuriosities), that provided the inspiration to include this feature on our site. Having a three-dimensional model that you can manipulate and zoom in on to see texture and detail allows us to bring the audience closer to the objects that are available in our archive, and I hope offers a more tangible, less abstract experience to site visitors. 

I am also extremely grateful to the scholars who contributed reflections on the objects: Macham Mangut, Akin Ogundiran, Arianna Ray, and Jessica Winegar. It is difficult to look at an object out of context, a souvenir gathered and kept that doesn’t carry many clues about its creator or its life before becoming part of a collection. We turned to scholars to shed light on these objects and fill in their historical context.
