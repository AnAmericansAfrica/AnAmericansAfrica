Born in Nairobi, Kenyan artist Wangechi Mutu gained widespread recognition and success in the art world soon after her graduation from the prestigious Yale School of Art. Her work often draws on her own experiences as a Black woman and a member of the African Diaspora and with her success, she has sought to aid other diasporic artists. With this goal in mind, Mutu founded Africa’s Out! to provide a platform for other African diasporic artists to advance their practice and shift Western perceptions of Africa, two major conceptual pillars throughout her oeuvre. 

Texture is prominent in all of her works across media, whether sculpture, drawing, collage, performance, or film as she seeks to dismantle and reform stereotypical visions of womanhood, particularly African womanhood. The women that preoccupy her art are simultaneously alluring and frightening, powerful and repulsive. Throughout, Mutu seeks to unite and empower women by celebrating and mystifying the female figure and the female psyche. Her collage Yo Mama, for example, depicts a version of the biblical first woman Eve, modeled after Nigerian feminist Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, who stands victorious over the vanquished snake sent by Satan. 

Due to the strange shapes and occasionally bionic elements of Mutu’s women, her art is frequently characterized as Afro-futurist, a theory and philosophy that unites African culture with an imagined or alternative future, binding them inextricably together. Yet her work also speaks to the prehistoric past and the “timeless, ancient language of art” that connects all humans and she often obliquely or overtly references art created by various ethnic groups across Africa, from the Makonde to the Yorbua.

Mutu, who splits her time between Nairobi and New York City, has directly addressed in interviews the importance of place to her identity and practice, both as a sensation of rootedness and as a way to bridge divides within and outside of Africa. The complexity of transnational politics and transnational life lies at the heart of many of her works.. She describes her home country as: “...a distinctly multi-ethnic and multicultural place, and despite its anglophone trauma, is a very attractive country… The city [Nairobi] is layered, lush, and encourages a coexistence between humans and the natural world."

In her recent Sentinel series of sculptures, made in her studio in Nairobi, Mutu employs ecological materials sourced from the land around her hometown in Kenya. Soil, paper pulp, bits of wood, rocks, and sea shells make up the stuff of this figurative sculptures, their skeletons and their skin. With the increasing precarity of climate change and its impact on Kenyan environments, the sculptures at once speak to the intertwined and increasingly precarious relationship of land, identity, and womanhood. When juxtaposed with the small busts that Lydia purchased during her trip, Mutu’s scupture complicates while reminaing in dialogue with conceptions of Kenyan womanhood.

## Syowia Kyambi

As a primarily multimedia installation and performance artist, Syowia Kyambi folds the past into the present through her characters that often evoke or are inspired by colonial history, particularly of her home country of Kenya. Educated at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Kyambi’s work has long explored the meaning of cultural identity, race, and womanhood as intertwined with the construction of history itself.

She often draws on archival research as a way to enrich her work and guide the impact she seeks to have on her audience. Her work, “Infinity: Flashes of the Past” exemplifies this mode of working. Drawing from images taken from the Nairobi National Museum’s archive, Kyambi hung scans in long laddered strings, each dialoguing with one another as they collectively spoke to the colonial construction of Kenya, from the violence of British rule to the fraught process of defining an independent state. 

One of her recent characters, Kaspale, grew out of such research. Kaspale is described as a trickster who is meant [“to intervene in spaces charged with colonial activities, to call out authority when necessary, and speak up when others cannot. ”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8f9Ok1hMvs&feature=youtu.be) Kapsale is clothed in a Kaunda suit (so named after a former Zambian president, made of mosquito netting and bears red paint and sprinkled gold on their mouth, hands, and feet.  Moving across time and space, Kaspale’s continuous presence and simultaneity also brings to the fore questions of memory and of loss. Such questions resonate with this project on Lydia’s journey, which, though much better-documented than most others, still bears absences throughout in the loss of the perspectives and identities of most of the Africans that appear in her documentary, are mentioned in her notes, or are behind the objects she brought home. Kaspale’s unique ability to transgress norms has to led to their fictional self-insertion into spaces of colonial violence, such as Nairobi’s Nyayo House, a former torture chamber used by the Kenyan government in the 1980s and 1990s.

Kyambi is conscious of her viewers as an artist who often engages multiple senses by combining performance, photography, video, sound, and sculpture. She has explained, “My work is messy, complex and uneasy and asks the viewer to bear witness to the hidden histories embodied in my work. The embodiment of collective experiences, and constant search for links between the now and the morphed now. I reveal the complex framework of prejudices that are based on Western romanticising of my context, East Africa and simultaneously explore the richness of my artistic self-reflexivity and ability to transform performatively.”
