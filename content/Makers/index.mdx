<h3>Contemporary artists from Africa</h3>
In this project, we incorporate the work of contemporary African artists as a response to the namelessness of the creators of the objects that Lydia collected. We center their perspectives to better understand the impact of White tourism on the historical record.

## Belgian Congo
  
During her week in the Belgian Congo in mid-February, Lydia focused on the country’s extraordinary nature and big game. Belgian Congo was a prosperous region owing to its extensive deposits of natural minerals like copper. By the 1950s, revolutionary sentiment had begun stirring among Africans who spoke out against the colonial regime. Lydia visited during a transitional period as more Congolese began to join a growing middle-class, though her characterization of the colony focuses instead on its rural areas, which she considered more authentically African.

## South Africa
  
Lydia began her journey in January 1953 in South Africa. In this era, South Africa’s National Party had gained power on the basis of instituting apartheid. By 1953, the government had already banned marriage between White and Black populations, instituted an official racial categorization system, and separated groups into different areas of settlements. Lydia traveled throughout South Africa for over three weeks, moving fluidly between these different spaces, both urban and rural, and particularly documenting her interactions with Indigenous Black communities.

## Kenya
  
Like many of the other countries Lydia visited, Kenya was a British colony up to its independence in 1964. For decades, the British had worked to suppress anti-colonial sentiment in Kenya. In the early ‘50s, while Lydia was in Kenya, the Mau Mau Uprising took place, with native Africans taking up arms against the colonial government. Many combatants and sympathizers were killed or tortured by the British in their attempt at suppression. Lydia briefly mentions seeing the bodies of nine dead Mau Maus but she says little else about her reaction to the evidence of violence.

 ## Egypt
  
Approximately six months prior to Lydia’s arrival in the country, Egypt had undergone a revolution, overthrowing the monarchy and instituting the Republic of Egypt. The changes that resulted –the withdrawal of remaining British troops, the acceleration of industrialization, and the growth of the economy – were all still in their infancy in early 1953. Like many tourists to Egypt, Lydia was seemingly more interested in its ancient past. She collected three appliqué panels imitating the Ancient Egyptian style and wrote about her visit to the Great Pyramid of Giza and observations of ongoing excavations.
