<h3>Contemporary artists from Africa</h3>
In this project, we incorporate the work of contemporary African artists as a response to the namelessness of the creators of the objects that Lydia collected. We center their perspectives to better understand the impact of White tourism on the historical record.

## Belgian Congo
  
  During her week in the Belgian Congo in mid-February, Lydia focused extensively on the country’s extraordinary nature and big game. She was there in the last years of the country’s status as a colony as it would achieve independence in 1960 and undergo several decades of political turmoil with the institution of an autocrat. It was a prosperous region owing to its extensive deposits of natural minerals like copper. By the 1950s, revolutionary sentiment had begun stirring among Africans who spoke out against the subjugation of the colonial regime. Lydia visited the Belgian Congo in a transitional period as more Congolese began to join a growing middle-class, though her characterization of the colony focuses instead on its rural areas, which she considered more authentically African.

## South Africa
  
 Lydia began her journey in January 1953 from South Africa, the southernmost country on the continent known for its diverse topography, natural beauty, and cultural richness. In this era, South Africa’s National Party had gained power on the basis of instituting apartheid, meaning “apartness” in Afrikaans. By 1953, the government had already banned marriage between White and Black populations, instituted an official racial categorization system for all individuals, and separated the different groups into different areas of settlement, often displacing Indigenous groups. Lydia traveled throughout South Africa for over three weeks, moving fluidly between these different spaces, both urban and rural, and particularly documenting her interactions with Indigenous Black communities.

## Kenya
  
Like many of the other countries Lydia visited, Kenya was a British colony up to its independence in 1964. For decades, the British had worked to suppress anti-colonial sentiment in Kenya. In the late ‘40s, an African nationalist group known as the Kenyan African Union began to demand more access to land and more representation. In the early ‘50s, while Lydia was in Kenya, the Mau Mau Uprising took place, as native Africans took up arms against the colonial government. Many combatants and sympathizers were killed or tortured by the British in their attempt at suppression. Lydia briefly mentions seeing the bodies of nine dead Mau Maus but she says little else about her reaction to the evidence of violence. She stayed at the famed Treetops Hotel, where the year prior Elizabeth II had learned of her father’s passing and became queen. She also took time to connect with a furrier in Nairobi, who transformed several leopard and monkey pelts she had purchased into purses and hats to wear back home in Illinois.
