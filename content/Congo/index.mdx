# Belgian Congo
  
## Introduction
During her week in the Belgian Congo in mid-February, Lydia focused extensively on the country’s extraordinary nature and big game. She was there in the last years of the country’s status as a colony as it would achieve independence in 1960 and undergo several decades of political turmoil with the institution of an autocrat. It was a prosperous region owing to its extensive deposits of natural minerals like copper. By the 1950s, revolutionary sentiment had begun stirring among Africans who spoke out against the subjugation of the colonial regime. Lydia visited the Belgian Congo in a transitional period as more Congolese began to join a growing middle-class, though her characterization of the colony focuses instead on its rural areas, which she considered more authentically African.
