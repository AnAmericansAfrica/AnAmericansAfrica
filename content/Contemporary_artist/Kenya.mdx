# Contemporary Artists
In this project, we incorporate the work of contemporary African artists as a response to the namelessness of the creators of the objects that Lydia collected. We center their perspectives to better understand the impact of White tourism on the historical record.

Born in Nairobi, Kenyan artist Wangechi Mutu gained widespread recognition and success in the art world soon after her graduation from the prestigious Yale School of Art. Her work often draws on her own experiences as a Black woman and a member of the African Diaspora and with her success, she has sought to aid other diasporic artists. With this goal in mind, Mutu founded Africa’s Out! to provide a platform for other African diasporic artists to advance their practice and shift Western perceptions of Africa, two major conceptual pillars throughout her oeuvre. 

Texture is prominent in all of her works across media, whether sculpture, drawing, collage, performance, or film as she seeks to dismantle and reform stereotypical visions of womanhood, particularly African womanhood. The women that preoccupy her art are simultaneously alluring and frightening, powerful and repulsive. Throughout, Mutu seeks to unite and empower women by celebrating and mystifying the female figure and the female psyche. Her collage Yo Mama, for exmaple, depicts a verison of the biblical first woman Eve, modeled after Nigerian feminist Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, who stands victorious over the vanquished snake sent by Satan. 

Due to the strange shapes and occasionally bionic elements of Mutu’s women, her art is frequently characterized as Afro-futurist, a theory and philosophy that unites African culture with an imagined or alternative future, binding them inextricably together. Yet her work also speaks to the prehistoric past and the [“timeless, ancient language of art”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhyvSk9cF0) that connects all humans and she often obliquely or overtly references art created by various ethnic groups across Africa, from the Makonde to the Yorbua.

Mutu, who splits her time between Nairobi and New York City, has directly addressed in interviews the importance of place to her identity and practice, both as a sensation of rootedness and as a way to bridge divides within and outside of Africa. The complexity of transnational politics and transnational life lies at the heart of many of her works.. She describes her home country as: “...a distinctly multi-ethnic and multicultural place, and despite its anglophone trauma, is a very attractive country… The city [Nairobi] is layered, lush, and encourages a coexistence between humans and the natural world."

In her recent Sentinel series of sculptures, made in her studio in Nairobi, Mutu employs ecological materials sourced from the land around her hometown in Kenya. Soil, paper pulp, bits of wood, rocks, and sea shells make up the stuff of this figurative scuptures, their skeletons and their skin. With the increasing precarity of climate change and its impact on Kenyan environments, the scuptures at once speak to the intertwined and increasingly precarious relationship of land, identity, and womanhood. When juxtaposed with the sculptures of women that Lydia brought back from Kenya,
