## Essay
The leopard-skin purse in Lydia Pederson’s collection evokes the sensibilities of power, desire, travel, discovery, and femininity beyond 1953 when she traveled to Africa and commissioned the piece from a furrier in Nairobi. Handbags have been the quintessential feminine accessory since the eighteenth century when they first became popular in Europe. They were part of the material revolution of the century when the world was awash with new consumption habits and increased mobility. Handbags were a liberating appendage of women's attire for keeping personal belongings and the needs of those who usually depended on their care--children. They have historically been perceived as a hallmark of concealment and a source of feminine independence and elegance. 

Pederson’s handbag is particularly compelling for its leopard pelt manufacture. Leopards evolved in Africa about 3 million years ago, at the beginning of the last Ice Age (Pleistocene). They are ecologically versatile animals and have been found in the wild in all vegetation zones of Africa, from the Mediterranean to the rainforest and beyond.   

Throughout African history, the leopard has been revered for its beauty, enigma, strength, swiftness, adaptability, and efficiency. As an apex predator, the leopard was associated with power and leadership. From Ancient Egypt to the Benin Kingdom, Kongo to Dahomey, kings, priests, warriors, and other high-ranking individuals donned leopard skin robes. They walked and sat on leopard skin carpets. Successful hunters exchanged leopard pelts for political favors and upward social mobility. A postcolonial African political leader and dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Zaire), adopted the leopard print in his sartorial display. With his leopard-skin hat and suit, Mobutu used the leopard imagery to project himself as a postcolonial reincarnation of Africa’s precolonial “warrior-ruler” tradition—a man to be feared and respected, generous and dangerous.

For most of African history, the leopard resided, sociologically, in the masculine domain because of its association with power and governance. Women of power also belonged to this masculine sphere. All of these changed in the early twentieth century as part of the disruptions caused by European colonialism in Africa. The European colonial settlers in East and Southern Africa targeted the big cats among the enemies to be subdued. Many European and American sport hunters, seeking to realize their own masculinity, traveled to Africa to hunt apex predators like lions, leopards, and cheetahs. This colonial masculinity fueled the desire for leopard pelts, which subsequently became synonymous with the modern white woman’s sensibility of luxury, femininity, and decadence. 

When Pederson traveled to Africa in the mid-century, the leopard print was the rage of high society. Due to its cultural and economic associations,  it projected the independence, autonomy, defiance, and boldness of the new upper- and middle-class Western woman. Initially, this desire for femininity was fueled by the hunting of African leopards for their valuable furs. Pederson’s travels in Africa embodied this independence of the new woman and the power of whiteness at the time. This leopard pelt purse and the accompanying documentation tell such a story of curiosity, desire, power, and mid-century femininity. It also reminds us of the colonial past and how Euro-American desire almost brought the leopard to extinction in Africa. The purse would have had an approving presence in her social scene, especially for its authenticity as a piece made from an authentic African leopard pelt, rather than a mere print. However, such authenticity is not without controversy today in conservation and animal rights circles. Pederson carefully kept the documentation to maintain the integrity of this original piece, giving us a window to view the past and our role in its making as we imagine how our present came to be.
