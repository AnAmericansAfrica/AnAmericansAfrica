## Essay
The Tray with design of snake is a unique and intricately decorated calabash, crafted from a gourd. It holds a special place in the Lydia Luhman Pederson collection as it was not collected by Lydia herself; it was instead her niece Sonjia Ulstad – the donor of the Pederson collection – who acquired it during her 1967 voyage to Nigeria. The art of calabash carving and decoration as seen here is a prevalent form of expression in Nigeria. With their outer parts removed, gourds are skillfully carved to create designs ranging from abstract patterns to animal shapes. These gourds are often dyed in vibrant colors such as red or black. 

Calabashes, present throughout Nigeria, serve various functions, including food storage, serving, and decoration. They can also be used as musical instruments or ritual objects, reflecting their multifaceted role in Nigerian culture. In northern Nigeria, for instance, women selling sour milk often use beautifully designed gourd bowls, a testament to the aesthetic value placed on these objects. Calabash in Hausa language, spoken in parts of northern Nigeria, is called “kwarya”. Northern states such as Bauchi, Sokoto, Adamawa, Katsina, and Borno are known for producing burnt and engraved geometrical designs calabashes. However, they have no significant spiritual connotations with the decorations primarily providing aesthetic enjoyment. 

Calabash decoration and usage is also common in Southwestern Nigeria. For example, it is prominent among the people of Oyo and other Yoruba speakers. Calabash is known in Yoruba as “igba”. Oyo is one of the most crafts-oriented towns in Yorubaland. In the ancient days of the O̩yo Empire̩, at O̩yo̩-ilé, wood and calabash carvers were situated behind the palace of supreme king of Oyo, the Aláàfin. A prominent carver among them was named Onírèsé, who was identified by an Ifa priest at birth as a great leader. At the commencement of the reign of a new Aláàfin, ‘Igba Iwà’ or calabashes of divination were brought from Ife to the new king to determine what his reign would entail. 

In addition to their uses, these objects often feature decorations of reptiles, birds, and other living things, each carrying its own symbolic meaning. A classic example is the Tray with the design of snake. Snakes are revered in many parts of Africa; the python, for example,depicts the war god Ogidia among the people of Benin and Brass of the Niger Delta region. Similarly, snakes are significant in Yoruba tradition, symbolizing rebirth and renewal. This symbolism is deeply rooted in Yoruba mythology, where the snake is associated with Osumare, a rainbow serpent god. The god is the son of the goddess Yemọja and the God Ọ̀rúnmìlà. Because snakes shed their skin, the god is associated with rebirth or renewal. This belief is carried by practitioners of Yoruba religion in Nigeria, Benin, Brazil, and Cuba, making the Tray with the design of snake a powerful transatlantic cultural object.
