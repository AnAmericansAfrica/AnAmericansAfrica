## Description
Though this sculpture cannot be definitively identified, based on the style of the profile and artistic traditions, it is likely of Kenyan or Tanzanian origin. It is one of many purchased by Lydia during her time in the region, including [this object stamped with “MADE IN KENYA.”](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/14ac980f-10fe-4a23-94fa-6fe8a0643068) Such dark wooden busts were in enormous demand among tourists, with many similar items still for sale by small auctioneers. This example is particularly distinctive, as the woman’s head sprouts out of the forehead of another figure and crowned by yet another female face. The juxtaposition of the three faces perhaps represent several different stages in a woman’s life. Together, they display the creativity and evocative power of works often categorized as “tourist art” by unidentifiable artists.
