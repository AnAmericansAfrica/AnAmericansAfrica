## Description
This small statuette is one of several purchased by Lydia that depicts a standing man holding a spear, though it is the only one to be made of ivory. Its precise origins are unknown but it stylistically accords with many extant statuettes from the Belgian Congo; the Lega were particularly adept at ivory carving, though this object more closely corresponds with Holo statuettes found in the Royal Museum for Central Africa. Ivory had long been coveted by those outside Africa and Asia for its unique material qualities and beauty. Lydia’s proclivity for warrior statuettes aligns with her collection of various weapons like bows, arrows, knives. Her focus on weaponry in many forms speaks to a long-lasting stereotype of African cultures as primitive hunter-gatherers.
