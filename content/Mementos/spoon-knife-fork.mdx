## Description
Each measuring over one foot long, these three wooden utensils feature stylized figures on their finials bearing headdresses and carrying small vessels. The silver rings around their necks point to a Ndebele origin. Women of this South African group adorned their necks with copper or brass rings known as dzilla, traditionally gifted by their husbands. Utensils like this set remain available on common ecommerce sites like eBay or Etsy, signaling their longlasting ubiquity as objects made for tourists like Lydia. Tourist art often took the form of functional objects that appealed to Westerners who sought a colonial vision of African tradition.
