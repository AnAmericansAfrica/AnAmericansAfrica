## Description
The origins of this woven miniature tea set cannot be firmly identified. Such objects rarely end up in museum collections as they appear to be of relatively little economic or artistic value. It perhaps comes from South Africa, as a similar example has been identified by an eBay dealer, though this cannot be taken as fact. Regardless, the presence of this set in Lydia’s belongings exemplifies much of her taste as a collector throughout her journey. She frequently sought utilitarian items that, through material or scale, could not actually function for their intended purpose.
