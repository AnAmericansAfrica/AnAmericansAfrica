    <td valign = "center" >In 1953, Lydia Luhman Pederson, a white woman from Illinois, embarked on a trip to Africa, laden with hundreds of pounds of film equipment and a packed itinerary that would take her from South Africa to Egypt.  Along the way she accrued objects and documented her thoughts on the peoples and cultures she encountered, reflecting the biases of a wealthy American woman. Many years later, the objects she gathered were donated to Northwestern libraries, where they form the Lydia Luhman Pederson collection at the Herskovits Library of African Studies. The collection consists of travel receipts, films, correspondence, documentary scripts, and the objects Lydia purchased.</td>
