    <td valign = "center" >In 1953, Lydia Luhman Pederson, a white woman from Illinois, embarked on a trip to Africa, laden with hundreds of pounds of film equipment and a packed itinerary that would take her from South Africa to Egypt.  Along the way she accrued objects and documented her thoughts on the peoples and cultures she encountered, reflecting the biases of a wealthy American woman. Many years later, the objects she gathered were donated to Northwestern libraries, where they form the Lydia Luhman Pederson collection at the Herskovits Library of African Studies. The collection consists of travel receipts, films, correspondence, documentary scripts, and the objects Lydia purchased. <br /><br />This digital exhibit explores the collection as a representation of what tourism reveals, and what it masks. While a scrapbook and souvenirs only scratch the surface, they ignite our curiosity about the authentic lives behind tourist spots. Throughout this cartographic pamphlet, you will find objects, receipts, and excerpts from Lydia’s journey alongside the works of contemporary African artists who provide an alternative perspective to the viewpoint that she represents.</td>

    <figcaption><strong>Leopard-skin Purse with Leopard Face</strong></figcaption><br />The leopard-skin purse in Lydia Pederson’s collection evokes the sensibilities of power, desire, travel, discovery, and femininity beyond 1953 when she traveled to Africa and collected the piece. Handbags have been the quintessential feminine accessory since the eighteenth century when they became popular in Europe... [View details](/LLP-Exhibition/objects/leopard-skin-purse)</td>
