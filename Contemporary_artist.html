In the early ‘50s, while Lydia was in Kenya, the Mau Mau Uprising took place, as native Africans took up arms against the colonial government. Many combatants and sympathizers were killed or tortured by the British in their attempt at suppression. Lydia briefly mentions seeing the bodies of nine dead Mau Maus but she says little else about her reaction to the evidence of violence. She stayed at the famed Treetops Hotel, where the year prior Elizabeth II had learned of her father’s passing and became queen.
